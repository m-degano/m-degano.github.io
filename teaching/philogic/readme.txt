Parts of Lecture 3 on semantic theories of truth is based on earlier lectures by Frank Veltman. Levin Hornischer, who has also taught this course, has written a nice set of notes on some of the themes typically covered in the course (and beyond), available here: https://github.com/LevinHornischer/PhilLogic, although the perspective on some topics there is different. The slides also elaborate on the readings suggested at the beginning of each deck and are therefore based on those readings.

**Assignment 1:** Exercise 3 is based on a well-known result by Tarski. A further follow-up question would be to consider the set of truth values over the rationals and over the reals, and to prove that, when \Gamma is infinite, (\Gamma \models_{reals} \phi) iff (\Gamma \models_{rationals} \phi) fails.

**Assignment 2:** Exercise 3 is based on Fara's argument and Cobreros's notion of regional truth.

**Assignment 3:** Exercise 1 relates to the Chrysippus Intuition problem discussed by Anil Gupta.

**Assignment 4:** Exercise 2 asks to prove the general form of soundness for an axiomatic system for tautological entailment, which is left to the reader in Belnap & Anderson’s work. Part of Exercise 3 on non-vacuous convex truthmaking was suggested by Soren Knudstorp, who was a TA for the course. The notion of non-vacuous convex truthmaking was introduced in Fine & Jago (2019).

**Assignment 5:** The exercises elaborate on earlier exercises contained in Frank Veltman's lecture notes on counterfactuals.

**Example Exam:** Exercise 2 is adapted from a previous exam exercise by Levin Hornischer. Exercise 3 concerns cumulative ordered models discussed by Kraus, Lehman, and Magidor (1990).

**Resit Exam:** The second part of Exercise 3 is based on a remark in Fine & Jago (2019).
